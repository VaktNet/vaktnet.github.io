    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
      In March 2020, the world stopped. Construction on projects like <em>Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind</em> and
      <em>TRON Lightcycle / Run</em> was halted, and planning for attractions such as <em>Tiana’s Bayou Adventure</em> went quiet. 
      When Disney furloughed ninety percent of the Global Engineering &amp; Technology (GE&amp;T) team, I was among the ten percent 
      chosen as the COVID ride‑out crew—those who “ride out” storms to protect and sustain the parks. Walking through Magic Kingdom, 
      EPCOT, Hollywood Studios, and Animal Kingdom completely empty was surreal and sobering, but our mission was clear: keep the parks 
      alive and ready for the day they would welcome guests again.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the parks reopened and projects restarted, I shifted from maintaining legacy systems to shaping the future. Over the next 
      three years, I led and implemented cyber architecture for <em>Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind</em>, 
      <em>TRON Lightcycle / Run</em>, and <em>Tiana’s Bayou Adventure</em>, while also supporting projects like the park‑wide 
      <em>DuckTales World Showcase Adventure</em>, <em>Harmonious</em>, and a sweeping legacy attraction remediation effort. 
      By the time I departed in early November 2023, I left behind secure, resilient networks that quietly power some of Disney’s 
      most ambitious experiences.

  <h3>Project Narrative</h3>

  <h4>Holding the Line in Empty Parks</h4>
  <p>
    Those first months of 2020 were unlike anything I had experienced. I was part of a small ride‑out crew—walking silent parks, 
    responding to maintenance trouble calls and cybersecurity detections, and planning distancing protocols while the world watched 
    and waited. We kept the heartbeat of the parks alive. Even as rides sat idle, our work ensured that when the time came to 
    reopen, the systems behind them would be ready.
  </p>

  <h4>Guardians and a New Way Forward</h4>
  <p>
    When projects restarted, <em>Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind</em> became my proving ground. 
    I managed the cyber remediation project while simultaneously designing and installing secure operational technology networks 
    for the attraction. I applied lessons learned from Galaxy’s Edge—segmentation, intrusion detection, and log collection—
    but refined them into a more efficient and resilient architecture. I worked side by side with Imagineers, contractors, 
    and Enterprise Technology teams, often spending mornings in project meetings and afternoons on ladders with tools in hand.
  </p>
  <p>
    Even as I focused on Guardians, I was also contributing to other efforts: implementing a park‑wide OT network for the 
    <em>DuckTales World Showcase Adventure</em> at EPCOT, supporting <em>Harmonious</em>, and helping drive a sweeping legacy 
    attraction remediation initiative—all while coordinating between creative, technical, and operational teams.
  </p>

      <h4>TRON, Tiana’s, and Overlapping Worlds</h4>
      <p>
        As Guardians neared completion, I shifted focus to <em>TRON Lightcycle / Run</em>, carrying forward everything we had learned 
        and improving efficiency even further. Cybersecurity wasn’t an afterthought; it was built in from the start, ensuring that 
        industrial controls, show systems, and guest‑facing networks worked in harmony without compromising safety. 
        By the time <em>Tiana’s Bayou Adventure</em> accelerated into active build, our team had a proven playbook—
        and I was once again wearing every hat: architect, integrator, field engineer, and cross‑functional liaison.

  <h4>Closing a Chapter</h4>
  <p>
    By October 2023, I had completed my portion of the cyber implementations—networks, monitoring, segmentation, and documentation 
    were all in place—leaving final scans and pen tests to those who would carry the baton forward. In early November, I stepped away 
    from Disney, leaving a permanent position to join the project team at Epic Universe. It was both exhilarating and nerve‑wracking, 
    but I carry a hope with me: that someday, I might return “home” to Disney with even greater experience, ready to help shape the 
    next chapter of magic.
