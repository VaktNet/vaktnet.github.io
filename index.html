  <!-- Bio -->
  <section>
    <p>
      <strong>VaktNet</strong> began as a mission-driven company—<strong>DataVakt LLC</strong>—a veteran-led effort launched in the aftermath of everything that was 2020, a year that felt like a long decade. It was born to bring enterprise-grade security and resilient networks to small and mid-sized businesses, nonprofits, and veteran service organizations during a time of rising threats and unstable markets. Though the company dissolved during my tenure at Disney due to global supply constraints, the ethos behind it lives on: infrastructure worth trusting, systems designed with vigilance, and leadership grounded in integrity.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve led <strong>OT/ICS cybersecurity</strong> initiatives across world-class <strong>themed entertainment</strong> destinations, built secure infrastructure at <strong>Department of Defense</strong> scale, and delivered high-availability systems across <strong>mission-critical</strong> environments. This site reflects that journey—what I’ve <strong>built</strong>, what I’ve <strong>learned</strong>, and how I <strong>lead</strong>.
