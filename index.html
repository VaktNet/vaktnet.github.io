    <h2>Guy Teets</h2>
     <p><strong>Cyber-Physical Systems & Infrastructure Security Leader</strong></p>
<p><strong>VaktNet<strong> began as a mission-driven company—<strong>DataVakt LLC</strong>—a veteran-led effort launched in the aftermath of everything that was 2020, a year that felt like a long decade. It was born to bring enterprise-grade security and resilient networks to small and mid-sized businesses, nonprofits, and veteran service organizations during a time of rising threats and unstable markets. Though the company dissolved during my tenure at Disney due to global supply constraints, the ethos behind it lives on: infrastructure worth trusting, systems designed with vigilance, and leadership grounded in integrity.</p>

<p>I’ve led <strong>OT/ICS cybersecurity<strong> initiatives across world-class <strong>themed entertainment<strong> destinations, built secure infrastructure at <strong>Department of Defense<strong> scale, and delivered high-availability systems across <strong>mission-critical<strong> environments. This site reflects that journey—what I’ve <strong>built<strong>, what I’ve <strong>learned<strong>, and how I <strong>lead<strong>.</p>
