    <h2>Guy Teets</h2>
    <p>Cybersecurity, Infrastructure, and OT Systems Leader</p>
<p>VaktNet began as a mission-driven company—<strong>DataVakt LLC</strong>—a veteran-led effort launched in the aftermath of everything that was 2020, a year that felt like a long decade. It was born to bring enterprise-grade security and resilient networks to small and mid-sized businesses, nonprofits, and veteran service organizations during a time of rising threats and unstable markets. Though the company dissolved during my tenure at Disney due to global supply constraints, the ethos behind it lives on: infrastructure worth trusting, systems designed with vigilance, and leadership grounded in integrity.</p>

<p>I’ve led OT/ICS cybersecurity initiatives across world-class themed entertainment destinations, built secure infrastructure at Department of Defense scale, and delivered high-availability systems across mission-critical environments. This site reflects that journey—what I’ve built, what I’ve learned, and how I lead.</p>
