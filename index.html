  <h2>Guy Teets</h2>
  <p class="job-title"><strong>Cyber-Physical Systems & Infrastructure Security Leader</strong></p>
  <p class="subtext">Technology Strategy & Innovation Leader</p>

  <p>
    Mission-driven technology leader with a proven record of impact across defense, themed entertainment, and critical infrastructure. Skilled at building and leading high-performing teams to solve complex challenges in wireless, cybersecurity, and enterprise network systems—delivering secure, resilient solutions aligned with regulatory, security, operational, and human needs. Known for bridging the gap between engineering precision and strategic vision, leading with integrity, curiosity, and a deep respect for the people in front of and behind the systems.

<p><strong>VaktNet</strong> began as a mission-driven company—<strong>DataVakt LLC</strong>—a veteran-led effort launched in the aftermath of everything that was 2020, a year that felt like a long decade. It was born to bring enterprise-grade security and resilient networks to small and mid-sized businesses, nonprofits, and veteran service organizations during a time of rising threats and unstable markets. Though the company dissolved during my tenure at Disney due to global supply constraints, the ethos behind it lives on: infrastructure worth trusting, systems designed with vigilance, and leadership grounded in integrity.</p>

<p>I’ve led <strong>OT/ICS cybersecurity</strong> initiatives across world-class <strong>themed entertainment</strong> destinations, built secure infrastructure at <strong>Department of Defense</strong> scale, and delivered high-availability systems across <strong>mission-critical</strong> environments. This site reflects that journey—what I’ve <strong>built</strong>, what I’ve <strong>learned</strong>, and how I <strong>lead</strong>.</p>
