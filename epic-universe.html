  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>When I stepped into my role as Parkwide Wireless Systems Manager in November 2023, Epic Universe had already been rising from the ground for nearly five years. The 750+ acre theme park campus was still taking shape‚Äîbut its wireless systems were far from complete. Only about 10% of Wi-Fi access points had been installed, temporary networks were incomplete, and no buildings had active Emergency Responder Radio Coverage (ERRC) systems. The project teams had deep rapport and well-established rhythms. I joined at a critical inflection point‚Äîjust 18 months from opening‚Äîcharged with evaluating in-progress designs, driving multimillion-dollar installations to the finish line, and integrating into a veteran team already steeped in the project‚Äôs culture.</p>

  <p>What followed wasn‚Äôt just a technical deployment‚Äîit was a trust-building, deadline-driven transformation of unfinished infrastructure into a resilient wireless backbone for guest experience, life safety, and operational readiness.</p>

  <p>I was called upon to help Dragons soar, Monsters roar, and each visiting Wizard expand their lore‚Äîto bring Nintendo‚Äôs world to life with Mario and Donkey Kong, and give the Celestials a fantastic cosmos to explore. In short, my team and I had to make magic real‚Äîby orchestrating the invisible infrastructure of radio frequency systems, the so-called ‚Äòdark magic‚Äô behind modern themed experiences.</p>

  <h3>Project Narrative</h3>

  <p><strong>I. Walking Into the Storm</strong></p>

  <p>When I first arrived on site, the scale of Epic Universe was awe-inspiring‚Äîbut its wireless infrastructure was skeletal. Construction was accelerating, yet most buildings lacked the conduit, power, and access pathways needed to support the complex systems ahead. Designs were already in motion. Equipment had been ordered. And contractors were ready to install. But I was just arriving. I had to quickly assess where things stood, identify critical gaps, and stay ahead of issues that could derail testing, onboarding, or operations. The margin for error was razor-thin.</p>

  <p>I walked floorplates in boots and hard hat, cross-referencing RF layouts against physical realities, flagging mismatches, and resolving them before they became rework. This wasn‚Äôt a blank slate‚Äîit was a moving target. My job was to navigate the chaos without stalling momentum‚Äîand still shape the outcome before the concrete dried.</p>

  <p><strong>II. Bridging Worlds, Building Trust</strong></p>

  <p>One of the most complex challenges wasn‚Äôt technical‚Äîit was cultural. The project teams had worked together for years, developing mutual trust and finely tuned working rhythms. As the new lead for wireless systems, I couldn‚Äôt simply dictate changes; I had to earn buy-in. I leaned heavily on my years in themed entertainment at Disney and the technical rigor I developed through DISA and active duty in the U.S. Navy. That background gave me both the credibility and humility to assess quickly, act decisively, and lead collaboratively.</p>

  <p>Rather than disrupt the work already in progress, I supported it. I cleared longstanding roadblocks that had delayed progress for weeks and empowered the existing wireless team to move forward without interruption. I listened first, removed friction, and focused on building momentum. I made it a point to learn everyone‚Äôs language‚Äîconstruction, creative, IT, and security‚Äîand to translate the wireless strategy into terms that aligned with each discipline‚Äôs priorities. That empathy, paired with deep technical knowledge, opened doors. Within weeks, I went from being ‚Äúthe new guy‚Äù to a trusted partner‚Äîsomeone teams called when they needed answers, clarity, or support. Once earned, trust became the fuel that turned coordination into momentum.</p>

  <p><strong>III. Engineering the Invisible</strong></p>

  <p>Wireless systems are unlike traditional infrastructure. They must be designed both on paper and in the air, shaped by steel, concrete, and motion. I led the full lifecycle of wireless deployment‚Äîconducting QA inspections, validating AP placement, and orchestrating field testing across Wi-Fi 6, BLE, LoRaWAN, and Motorola two-way systems. Early on, I walked the site alongside the Parks Technology Infrastructure Responsible Individuals (PTI-RIs), not only to verify conduit and cable readiness but to earn their trust and identify where I could have the greatest impact. That partnership ensured seamless coordination across disciplines‚Äîand revealed where support was most needed.</p>

  <p>I also expanded temporary wireless coverage using <strong>Peplink and MiMosa point-to-point (PTP) networks</strong>, essential for jobsite communications and safety operations. In one instance, a newly deployed PTP node enabled a worker to place a Wi-Fi call after his colleague suffered a serious hand injury. Without that coverage, they would‚Äôve had to leave the scene to find a signal‚Äîdelaying the emergency response. It was a sobering reminder that ...</p>
  <blockquote class="pull-quote"><strong><em>These systems weren‚Äôt just spec-sheet items‚Äîthey were silent guardians of safety.</em></strong></blockquote>
  
  <p>Every network‚Äîpermanent or temporary‚Äîhad to meet strict criteria for availability, resilience, corporate cybersecurity governance, and regulatory compliance. I coordinated FCC licensing and spectrum usage across a dense, multi-layered frequency environment to mitigate interference.</p>

  <p>This wasn‚Äôt just infrastructure‚Äîit was the real-time orchestration of dynamic, interdependent layers of signal, space, and safety.</p>

  <p><strong>IV. Delivery Without Compromise</strong></p>

  <p>As the park neared operational turnover, my focus shifted from deployment to assurance. I reviewed scopes of work, led walkouts, and documented field conditions to resolve issues before they became failures. Partnering with UPT Wireless Engineering and Universal‚Äôs Technical Services‚Äîthe teams responsible for long-term operations‚ÄîI facilitated site-level testing, including <strong>Wi-Fi surveys using Ekahau</strong>, <strong>two-way radio analysis with a FieldFox spectrum analyzer</strong>, and integrated readiness walkthroughs with future owners.</p>

  <p>At every step, I emphasized clarity and continuity: how systems were designed, how they were validated, and how they would be supported once the builders stepped away. I delivered stakeholder briefings and final turnover documentation for Hotel Operations, Park Operations, Security, and Wireless Engineering‚Äîincluding not just the <strong>immaculate records</strong> required for audit, but also <strong>desktop quick-reference guides</strong> I created proactively. They weren‚Äôt required. But I knew future operators would need them when no one else was around. I didn‚Äôt just deliver wireless systems‚ÄîI delivered confidence. Systems ready to support thousands of daily guests and hundreds of staff. Not just on paper, but in real life.</p>

  <p><strong>Conclusion: The Hidden Architecture of Magic</strong></p>

  <p>Epic Universe wasn‚Äôt just a construction project‚Äîit was a living system coming online in real time. My role was to ensure its wireless backbone was not only complete, but <strong>resilient, intuitive, and trusted</strong> from day one. That meant aligning a complex web of partners‚Äîincluding AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Crown Castle, CTS, WWT, HNM, Motorola, Skeene‚Äôs Technology Solutions (STS), West Networks, Summit Broadband, and CBRS providers‚Äîinto a unified deployment strategy. I brought clarity where there was friction, empowered internal teams, and delivered results without disrupting the creative rhythm of the project.</p>

  <p>What I left behind aren't just a finished systems‚Äîthey are <strong>a foundation</strong> that enables security, operations, and storytelling to flow together seamlessly. And while guests may never see the systems we built, they‚Äôll feel the impact every time a show launches on cue, a call for help is answered instantly, or a connection just works‚Äîquietly, flawlessly, and exactly when it matters most.</p>
